Great question 👍

Let’s break it down:

### 🔹 Purpose of `#overlay`

In your HTML, you wrapped the image like this:

```html
<div id="image">
  <div id="overlay"></div>
  <img src="...">
</div>
```

The **overlay** is basically a transparent (or semi-transparent) `<div>` placed **above the image**. Its main purposes are:

1. **Event handling layer**

   * Mouse events like `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, and `mousemove` sometimes behave unpredictably when you interact directly with the `<img>` tag.
   * An image can cause jitter because the mouse might quickly move in and out of its boundaries (especially if the image loads with rendering delays or anti-aliasing edges).
   * With an overlay (a `<div>` that fully covers the image), events are triggered smoothly because the overlay is a stable rectangular element.

2. **Styling layer**

   * Developers often use an overlay to add effects like **darkening, gradients, hover highlights, or blending** without directly modifying the image.
   * Example: On hover, you could make the overlay fade in with a semi-transparent black background, giving a “dimmed image” effect.

---

### 🔹 Why does it jitter without overlay?

If you rely directly on the `<img>`:

* The **cursor event triggers** on the exact pixel boundary of the image.
* Images don’t always have perfect hitboxes due to scaling, resolution, or rendering edges.
* As you move the mouse quickly, the browser may flicker between *inside* and *outside* the image → causing `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` to fire rapidly → jitter effect.

With the overlay:

* The overlay is a **solid, rectangular div** covering the entire image area.
* No pixel edges or transparency issues.
* The mouse events fire smoothly, preventing jitter.

---

✅ **Summary**:
The **overlay acts as a stable hitbox and style layer**.

* Without it → direct image event handling = jittery mouseenter/leave.
* With it → smooth, predictable hover and extra styling possibilities.

👉 Do you want me to also show you a CSS setup where you **don’t need overlay** (but still avoid jitter) by making the `<img>` behave like a block element with a reliable hitbox?


Perfect — thanks for sharing your CSS.
Right now, the `#overlay` is solving the jitter problem for you because it’s a stable rectangle above the image. But since you asked about **optimizing without overlay**, here’s what you can do:

### 🔹 Optimized CSS (no overlay needed)

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family: gilroy, sans-serif; /* 'font-size: gilroy;' was wrong */
}

html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

html, body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background: #212121;
}

#main {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: burlywood;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

#image {
    width: 50rem;
    height: 20rem;
    position: relative;
    border-radius: 2rem;
    overflow: hidden;       /* 🔑 ensures img never spills outside */
}

#image img {
    display: block;         /* 🔑 removes inline-gap hitbox issues */
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    border-radius: 2rem;
    object-fit: cover;      /* optional: keeps proportions neat */
}

#cursor {
    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    background-color: whitesmoke;
    border-radius: 50%;
    position: fixed;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 70px;      /* centers text vertically */
    z-index: 9999;          /* always above everything */
    pointer-events: none;   /* 🔑 prevents cursor div blocking events */
    transition: background-color 0.3s, transform 0.3s;
}
```

### 🔑 Key Fixes Explained

1. **`display: block;` on `img`**

   * Images default to `inline-block`, which leaves tiny gaps and causes mouseenter/mouseleave flicker. Making it a block removes that.

2. **`overflow: hidden;` on `#image`**

   * Keeps the image strictly inside its container, no pixel-edge leaking.

3. **`pointer-events: none;` on `#cursor`**

   * Ensures your custom cursor itself never interferes with hover events.

4. **`z-index` bump**

   * Keeps your cursor always above everything without needing an overlay.

5. **Removed `#overlay` completely**

   * You no longer need it — your hitbox is now the smooth `#image` container itself.

---

👉 With this setup, you’ll have **smooth mouseenter/mouseleave events on the container** and **no jitter**, without needing an extra overlay div.

Do you want me to also adjust your **JS logic** slightly so hover is applied on `#image` reliably (instead of juggling overlay)?
